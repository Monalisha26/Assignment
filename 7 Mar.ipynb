    "2. **Scale:**\n",
    "   - **Covariance:** The magnitude of covariance is influenced by the scale of the variables. Therefore, it is not easily interpretable, and comparing covariances across different datasets with different scales can be challenging.\n",
    "   - **Correlation:** Correlation is not affected by the scale of the variables. It is always between -1 and 1, providing a standardized measure that allows for easier interpretation and comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - **Covariance:** Positive covariance indicates a positive relationship (both variables tend to increase or decrease together), and negative covariance indicates a negative relationship (one variable tends to increase as the other decreases). However, the magnitude of covariance is not easily interpretable.\n",
    "   - **Correlation:** Correlation values range from -1 to 1. A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. The magnitude of the correlation coefficient provides information about the strength of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normalization:**\n",
    "   - **Covariance:** Covariance is not normalized, meaning it doesn't have a standardized scale. The covariance values depend on the units of the variables.\n",
    "   - **Correlation:** Correlation is normalized, making it a more suitable measure for comparing the strength of relationships across different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while covariance and correlation both measure the relationship between two variables, correlation provides a more interpretable and standardized measure that is independent of the scale of the variables. Correlation is widely used in statistical analysis because of its ease of interpretation and comparability."

    "Outliers can significantly impact measures of central tendency and dispersion in a dataset. Central tendency measures include the mean, median, and mode, while measures of dispersion include range, variance, and standard deviation. Here's how outliers affect these measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Central Tendency:**\n",
    "   - **Mean:** Outliers can have a substantial effect on the mean. Since the mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values, outliers, especially if they are extreme, can pull the mean in their direction. This makes the mean sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "   - **Median:** The median is less affected by outliers because it is not influenced by extreme values. It is the middle value when the data is sorted, and outliers do not impact its position as much.\n",
    "   - **Mode:** The mode is generally not affected by outliers since it represents the most frequently occurring value(s), and it is less sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dispersion:**\n",
    "   - **Range:** Outliers can significantly affect the range, as it is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. If there are outliers, the range may be much larger than the spread of the bulk of the data.\n",
    "   - **Variance and Standard Deviation:** Outliers can have a substantial impact on variance and standard deviation because they are influenced by the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Outliers can result in larger squared differences, leading to an inflated variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Consider the dataset: \\([10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 100]\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Without Outlier:**\n",
    "  - Mean: $$( \\frac{10+12+15+18+20}{5} = 15 )$$\n",
    "  - Median: ( 15 )\n",
    "  - Variance: $$( \\frac{(10-15)^2 + (12-15)^2 + (15-15)^2 + (18-15)^2 + (20-15)^2}{5} = 14 )$$\n",
    "  - Standard Deviation: $$( \\sqrt{14} \\approx 3.74 )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **With Outlier:**\n",
    "  - Mean: $$( \\frac{10+12+15+18+20+100}{6} = 28.33 )$$\n",
    "  - Median: $$( 16.5 )$$\n",
    "  - Variance: $$( \\frac{(10-28.33)^2 + (12-28.33)^2 + (15-28.33)^2 + (18-28.33)^2 + (20-28.33)^2 + (100-28.33)^2}{6} \\approx 969 )$$\n",
    "  - Standard Deviation: $$( \\sqrt{969} \\approx 31.12 )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the outlier (100) significantly influenced the mean, making it much larger than the median. This, in turn, affected the measures of dispersion, with the variance and standard deviation being substantially higher when the outlier is included. The median, being less sensitive to outliers, remained closer to the central tendency of the majority of the data points."
