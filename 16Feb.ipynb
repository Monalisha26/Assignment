    "1.SQL (Structured Query Language) databases, also known as relational databases, are based on the relational model, which represents data in the form of tables with rows and columns while NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are  non-relational databases which includes a variety of database systems that differ from traditional relational databases in terms of data models, query languages, and storage architectures.\n",

    "3.In SQL  data is consistent and follows strict integrity rules defined by the schema while NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over immediate consistency.\n",
